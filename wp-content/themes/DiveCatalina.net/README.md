TODO
---
+ subpages for "Meet the Staff"
+ chrome renders footer address improperly (fixed, double check on your machine)
+ pages appear further down (more padding on top) than the mockups

ADDED 12/24/12
+ Dive Catalina not going back to home page
+ Mobile menu not working/showing
+ Footer <hr/> missing
+ Double check color and font changer.
+ Make a cheat sheet for color and font changer.
+ I need a walkthrough on the templates (2 Default, 1 single page) - JEM
+ We don't need a template for each page, could just use default on others
+ front-page.php overwrites the home page. Do we want that?
