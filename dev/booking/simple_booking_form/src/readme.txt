Simple Booking form for WordPress.  An instant setup, free booking request form for your WordPress hotel, B&B, or accommodation website!  

== Description ==

This plugin allows in seconds to install a quick booking request form for your WordPress hotel, B&B, or accommodation website. Use the [BOOKINGFORM] shorttag in pages and posts - a booking form will show up. A Widget form is provided too. Cool date calendars are provided too for checkin and checkout date entries. 

Thanks to Frequency Decoder for the Date Picker Script.

What happens after submitting a form:

The submitted form data will be immediately sent via email both to the site administrator and to the  user that submitted the request, after some field validation of course, all fields except the notes are compulsory, and the email must be in a valid format.
Data is not stored into the WordPress database.

This form is also useful for Multiple apartment/B&B/accommodations websites, as you can embed mutiple forms too.
The form will send in the email also the name of the post/page where the form itself  was submitted: so when you read the email, you can figure out from which (accommodation) page the request was sent.
 You can use the shorttag once per every page / post.

Install and activate the plugin.
Then add the [BOOKINGFORM] shorttag in pages and posts. 

Or, if you prefer, a Widget form is provided too.

And the same email of course is sent to the client submitting the request.
